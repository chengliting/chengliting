As an experienced front-end developer, I am passionate about creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. With five years of experience under my belt, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have worked with various technologies like React, Vue and Mini Program.

## My key skills include:
- Developing responsive and intuitive interfaces using modern front-end frameworks and libraries.
- Building efficient and scalable code with reusable components.
- Implementing complex UI designs and interactions.
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to solve technical challenges and deliver high-quality products.

## My current focus:
Currently, I am working on improving my skills in Typescript. I am also passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest front-end technologies, tools, and trends, and always looking for ways to improve the user experience.
